Thank you for participating for DLRC RUN2EDUCATE 2024. Your support has gone a long way in visualizing DLRC's vision to open a Samajbandh ASHA Pad production center on DLRC Campus. We will be inaugurating the Center on 15 August 2024 at 9:30am. We would love to have you on campus to see the fruits of your contribution. You can also donate clothes for the production center. Please see the attached flyer for details. 
In case you are not able to come on 15th, you could do a donation drive in your society and visit our campus on a later date. 

Looking forward to more such participations...
With warm regards,
Team DLRC & Samajbandh
